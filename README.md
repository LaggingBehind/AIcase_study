# AI Case Study: DeepMind Alphafold

## Overview and Origin

* Google's DeepMind 

* Incorporated, 2010

* Company founders, Demis Hassabis & John Jumper

* With Alphago, DeepMind defeated the worlds best player of Go. They thought of what other fields this could be used for this machine learning and AI program, and set their sites on Protein structures.

* Google purchased DeepMind in 2014 for around $600 million and receives continuous funding from its' parent firm Alphabet. Along with independent investors such as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.

## Business Activities

* Deepmind's Alphafold is trying to solve the protein folding problem. Determining a proteins structure has been a very slow and expensive process, that has required years of work and specialized equipment. Alphafold is using algorithms to computationally analyze amino acid sequences to predict the folded structure.

* The company's customer base is composed of Biotech, Pharmaceutical Industry, Academic Researchers and Structural Biologists. The market size of this set of customers is not exact but the global biotechnology market is estimated at $1.76 trillion. 

* Competitors currently cannot compete with DeepMinds access to immense computational power and cutting edge deep learning expertise. This makes them the leader spearheading the protein structure prediction. 

* Alphafolds technologies are composed of complex mathematical models designed to replicated the neural network structure of a human brain. These neural networks work in unison to predict the distance of angles between the amino acid in the protein sequence, while factoring in evolutionary relationships between proteins that refine the final structure prediction. 

## Landscape

* DeepMind is a Artificial Intelligence field based company, specifically focusing on the subfield known as Machine learning to solve complex problems like protein structure with Alphafold.

* The past 5-10 years has been monumental for the AI industry. With the advancements of things like; Deep Learning completely revolutionized the AI industry, achieving human level and even surpassing human level performance in some areas. And Democratization of AI with Cloud Computing. This has laid the path for AI to be readily available for a wide range of users, including startups, researchers and individual developers for acceleration and innovation fueling growth for the AI ecosystem.

* Some of the major companies in this field include.
Google
Microsoft
Amazon
Meta
Apple

## Results

* DeepMind's has had substantial impacts as a company by creating the Alphafolds AI system that can accurately predict protein structures. which are the building blocks of life and the universe as we know it. Along with multiple other AI system's for instance, an AI system that can control plasma in the nuclear fusion process that could revolutionize the energy process. 

#### Metrics used to measure the success would include,
##### Performance:
* An overall assessment of the functionality of the AI system, including things like, accuracy, errors, responsiveness etc..

##### financial impact:
* things like the creators start up cost vs return on investment and revenue streams that are generated. 

##### customer relation:
* How well does it meet the customers needs and are they satisfied with the product? Also judging user engagement and usage.

Deepmind is excelling in this field demonstrating a real global impact. However, Deepmind is a subsidiary company to Googles Alphabet which makes it difficult to know the financial data of its overall performance.
* The companies performance is at the highest level. Staying in the race with the largest AI developers in the world. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
